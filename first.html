Hi<br>

This website contains data from <a href="http://domo.wikia.com/wiki/Domo_Wiki">DOMO Wiki</a> that was originally created by Poly from the Aeria Sapphire server. <br>
It was then handed over to Sakuraba and is now being translated and maintained by ephy from Subagames' Pandora server.<br><br><br><br><br>
